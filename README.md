### Anime Finder is a simple app (still in development) for anime, manga using JIKAN Api

	I built this just to learn better .Net MAUI and C#, I really love mobile development 
	and I wanted to build an app base on my second passion (Anime) if you don't figured it 
	out yet.

	To say more, I need help to build this, by giving ideas, writing the code for the app.


	If you like the project idea, or have a great a idea of an feature, or you know some 
	C#, send me a message on Discord. Or make a PR. Thanks.

#### Bugs 
	- By now I have these problems CollectionView that I use, I wanted to make to feel like an infinite scroll
	so I used RemainingItemsThreshold Propertie but the command gets called more that one time so thats it's a bad thing
	because the API has rate limitig some will throw Exception. 

	I will add more... You can also add by creating a new issue
